- Gentle Reframing: "When things go wrong repeatedly, our mind can start painting everything in black and white. Let’s pause... can you think of one small thing you handled okay?"
- Crisis Response: "I’m really sorry you’re feeling this much pain. You don’t have to face this alone. Talking to a trusted person or a mental health professional could really help."
